This package provides utility functions for computing the exact results of finite-size free fermion systems determined by the real-space hopping coefficients. Since free fermions can be exactly solved with $O(N^3)$ complexity, it offers a cheaper way (compared to ED) for benchmarking newly implemented tensor network algorithms in real space.
